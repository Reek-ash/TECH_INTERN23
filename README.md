Description: Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in C/C++.
Usage: Compile and run the program to sort an array of integers using the Quick Sort algorithm.
## Heap Sort
`File: heap_sort.cpp`
Description: Implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm in C/C++.
Usage: Compile and run the program to sort an array of integers using the Heap Sort algorithm.
## Shell Sort
`File: shell_sort.cpp`
Description: Implementation of the Shell Sort algorithm in C/C++.
Usage: Compile and run the program to sort an array of integers using the Shell Sort algorithm.
## Tree Sort
`File: tree_sort.cpp`
Description: Implementation of the Tree Sort algorithm in C/C++.
Usage: Compile and run the program to sort an array of integers using the Tree Sort algorithm.
# Level 2: Graph Algorithms
## Dijkstra's Algorithm
`File: dijkstra.cpp`
Description: Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph in C/C++.
Usage: Compile and run the program to find the shortest path in a given graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
## Kruskal's Algorithm
`File: kruskal.cpp`
Description: Implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree in a graph in C/C++.
Usage: Compile and run the program to find the minimum spanning tree in a given graph using Kruskal's Algorithm.
## Prim's Algorithm
`File: prims.cpp`
Description: Implementation of Prim's Algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree in a graph in C/C++.
Usage: Compile and run the program to find the minimum spanning tree in a given graph using Prim's Algorithm.
# Level 3: Finding Second-Largest Element
## Find Second-Largest Element
`File: secondlargest.cpp`
Description: C/C++ program to find the second-largest element in an array without sorting.
Usage: Compile and run the program to find the second-largest element in a given array.
# Level 4: Maximum Width of a Binary Search Tree
Maximum Width of Binary Search Tree

`File: bst.cpp`
Description: C/C++ program to find the maximum width of a binary search tree.
Usage: Compile and run the program to find the maximum width of a given binary search tree.
# Level 5: Game Character Simulation
This project implements a game simulation where players can control different characters, such as warriors, archers, and mages. Each character has a set of abilities that they can use during gameplay. The program is written in C++ and utilizes object-oriented programming concepts.

`File: game.cpp`
Description: C++ program to simulate the game where players control different characters and use their abilities.
Usage: Compile and run the "game.cpp" file to create and control characters, select and use abilities, and display the current game status.

# Prerequisites
